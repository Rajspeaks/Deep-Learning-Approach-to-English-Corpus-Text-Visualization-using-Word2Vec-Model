# English Corpus Text Visualization using Word2Vec Model

Machine Learning approach to English Corpus Text-visualization using Word2Vec Model from Gensim Library in NLP.

## Library requirements:

1. Sklearn: Used for data preprocessing, model selection, classification, Regression, clustering.
2. Matplotlib: It's used for 2D or 3D plotting to show Histogram, Bar-Chart etc
3. Gensim: Open Source Library used in Text Analysis, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec.
4. Used Melon Honey font & sample texts are collected from the Internet.

## Word2Vec

Word2Vec model is used in word embedding. I have used here Gensim library & Matplotlib-pyplot for 2d visualization of corpus.

## Methodology:

1. First I took an English Corpus applied punctuation remover.
2. Splitted the data & visualized the corpus using.
3. Repeated the Process taking larger corpus.

## Tools: 
1. Google Colab
